- 👋 Hi, I’m @JustNikki 👀 I’m just graduated from Yandex Practicum testers course and looking for a job in IT as a tester or qa-enjineer.
- 🌱 Currently learning JS/HTML/CSS for self-improvement.
- 🌱 Check out my playground brach (https://github.com/JustNikki/JustNikki/tree/playground). I am the beginner, but I gradually improve my skills to proceed up to the next level. This is the place to showcase my progress step by step.
